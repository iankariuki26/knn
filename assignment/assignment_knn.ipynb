    "MY ANSWERS\n",
    "\n",
    "1 -----\n",
    "    Classification is when you are predicting a certain categorical outcome while regression is when your prediction is numeric\n",
    "    K-means is an example of a model that utilizes classification, sepreating data into different clusters(categories), while a linear regression is a model that utilizes regression, making prediction using a best fit equation\n",
    "\n",
    "2 -----\n",
    "    A confusion table is a cross-tabulation table of a models predicted values as well as it's actual values. It allows us to see how far or close \n",
    "    the predicted values are to the actual values, providing us reference to see whether a model preforms well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 -----\n",
    "    Sum of squared error sums the distance each actual data point is from its predicted values squared, which gives us insight to how accurate model preforms\n",
    "    by telling us the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4 -----\n",
    "    Overfitting is when your model is too conformed to your training data making it unrealistically precise for it to be useful for prediction on data outside of the model while underfitting happens when your model is too simple or abstracted to make any meaningful explanation of the data's trend. Both should be attempted to be as small as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "5 -----\n",
    "    Splitting the data into training and model sets allows for us to test the accuracy of our model by giving utilizing the \"uncertain\" part of the data and\n",
    "    using that to represent the real uncertainty of future predictions. We can see how well our model from the training data preforms with the testing data by calculating the sum of sqaured error to see how far they deviate from eachother, and compare those deviations from models where k is greater or smaller\n",
    "    in size of the neigbors we want to utilize. Which ever model returns the smallest sse is would be the the model with the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6 -----\n",
    "    Doing classification by predicting a single class label is easier for the user to interpret and ultilze but it doesnâ€™t give insight to how confident the model actually is. When using predicting probabilities in classificationg, more information is given which is better for decisions, but it's weakness is that it is more difficult to interpret and it takes more computational power. Using probability predictions would be better for making important decisions, while using the single labels work well for simple tasks."
